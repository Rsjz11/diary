I will be developing an application incorporating at a minimum these four features.
    1. Login & logout
    2. Sign-up
    3. Upload image
    4. CRUD resource.
        Crud is an acrynom that delineates.
            C = Create
            R = Read
            U = Update
            D = Destroy

Idea of the Application:
    A piece of software that enables the user to save various tallies in the program under specific titles. 
    For example a group of friends may wish to play a game of among us, darts or poker and wish to keep trach of certain elements.
    This will be possible through the utilisation of this application. 
    Currently my friends utilise excel and though excel is a capable program, it seems clanky and struggles to handle larger amounts of data.
    I expect in my program to enable users to create their own account with an image to add personal touch. In addition to satisfy the CRUD requirement,
    users will be able to create their own titles and tables, read the contents, update and destroy when necessary.
